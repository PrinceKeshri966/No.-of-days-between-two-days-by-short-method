📅 Number of Days Between Two Dates
📖 Overview
This is a simple Python project built during my first semester to calculate the number of days between two given dates. It was one of my initial projects focused purely on understanding date manipulation and building logic without any frontend interface.

🧠 Description
The program uses a long-form method (without relying on Python’s built-in date libraries) to manually compute the total number of days between two dates. It’s a great exercise to grasp foundational concepts like:

Leap year calculations

Days in each month

Basic control structures and logic building in Python

🛠️ Tech Stack
Python (Core Logic)

No frontend – purely console-based

🚀 How It Works
The user is prompted to input two dates (start and end).

The program calculates the difference in days using custom logic.

Edge cases like leap years and month-end boundaries are handled manually.

🎯 Purpose
This project was developed as a learning exercise to strengthen my understanding of:

Conditional statements

Loops and iteration

Manual date handling

Writing clean, logical Python code

🤝 Contributions
While this is a basic project, suggestions for improvement or optimization are always welcome!
